# week-10-svg-logo-maker

## Description
This application allows web developers to create custom logos without hiring a graphic designer. The application uses inquirer to prompt users for logo preferences by asking up to three characters of text for the title, text color, and shape (triangle, square, or circle) with a corresponding color. After answering the prompts, the application then generates an SVG file with the user's selections in a logo form. The app showcases the potential of back-end developers and as well as the importance of unit testing, even for smaller projects. 

## Usage
To run this application, use the command line to navigate to the directory of the application, install all the dependencies (npm i), then type the  'node index.js'. You will then be taken through a series of questions. Once all questions have been answered correctly a message will display to the command line telling you your logo has been generated. Find your new logo in the newly generated SVG file.
